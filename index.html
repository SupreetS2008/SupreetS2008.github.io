        <h2>About This Project & Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], a local high school student with a passion for photography and community service. Flicks_Focused is my initiative to make quality photography available to everyone in Melissa, TX, especially those for whom traditional photography services might be too expensive.</p>
        <p>Beyond providing affordable photos, a significant portion of every fee covers project operational costs, with the remainder going directly to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. This project is a way for me to give back to my community, hone my photographic skills, and demonstrate my commitment to service as I prepare for college applications.</p>
        <p>I specialize in [mention your strong suits, e.g., capturing candid moments, creating natural portraits, focusing on product details] and am dedicated to delivering images you'll cherish.</p>
